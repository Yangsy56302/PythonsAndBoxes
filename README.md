# PythonSandbox

**PythonSandbox** is a sandbox game using Python for code, like its *temp* name.

## Game info

Assets and data are stored in some .json file, so anyone can change it for fun.

Multiplayer is not in our plan.

This game is free for now (maybe free forever).

## How to play

Download all files and put them into one directory.

Make sure the **assets** floder and the **data** floder are in the right place.

If **main.exe** exists, just run it.

If not, but you have Python3 and pip, run **pre-build.bat** and **build.bat**. The executable file should be created in few minutes.

### Controls

* **Space**: Jump
* **A**: Move left
* **D**: Move right
* **BackQuote**: Zoom in by 2x
* **Delete**: Quit game

## Version

* Ver.0: Unfinished...
